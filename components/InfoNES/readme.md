# InfoNes
[InfoNES](https://github.com/jay-kumogata/InfoNES) is a Family Computer emulator that runs on SDL/Linux.
It is easy to port.  
# Port
InfoNES can be ported to esp32, `InfoNES_Syetem.c` is a porting file.  
Because of limitation of ram, porting is not completely. Only the video part is ported. No sound available.
# another port
I also port it to SDL2 and webassembly.See [InfoNES-port](https://github.com/liux-pro/InfoNES-port).
