# InfoNes
[InfoNES](https://github.com/jay-kumogata/InfoNES) is a Family Computer emulator that runs on SDL/Linux.
It is easy to port.  
Original InfoNES takes a lot of ram.  
[pico-infones](https://github.com/shuichitakano/pico-infones) reduce ram usage, and do a lot of optimization.  
My GameLite is based on pico-infones from now.
# another port
I also port it to SDL2 and webassembly.See [InfoNES-port](https://github.com/liux-pro/InfoNES-port).
